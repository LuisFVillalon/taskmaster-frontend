// what used to be ~14 independently hand-rolled backdrop divs (each with its
// own ad-hoc z-50/z-[60]/z-[70]/z-[80] literal and inconsistent Escape/
// backdrop-click support) into one place. Deliberately owns only the
// structural chrome, not header/footer markup — each modal's internal layout
// varies enough (title size, extra header actions, footer buttons) that
// forcing a single header component would risk visual drift; this component
// only changes *how modals open/close/stack*, not how they look inside.
